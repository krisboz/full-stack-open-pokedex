So i did the  11.3 - 11.4 exercises
one TODO though, dig deeper into the syntax of jobs
also the date and ls commands
https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html
https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html

figure out how the documentation works

the way i see it now the synopsis shows it theoretically how its used
and under it there is a real life example with all the further options underneath
which we should all be able to just put after the date
